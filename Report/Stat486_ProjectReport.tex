\section*{Introductory Description}
\hspace{\parindent} 

    The data set \href{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult}{adult} from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository in 1996 was extracted from the 1994 Census database, with a total of 15 variables to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $\$50$k

    The 15 variables were respectively: \texttt{age, workclass, fnlwgt, education, educationnum, $\linebreak$ martialstatus, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capitalgain, capitalloss, hoursperweek, nativecountry, 50k}

    First, we removed variables \texttt{capitalgain, capitalloss} simply due to most observations having missing values for them, then we removed variables \texttt{fnlwgt} as we note \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income}{here}, \texttt{fnlwgt} being heavily determined by \texttt{age, race, sex} will produce high multicollinearity. We removed \texttt{education} for the same reason, as it's simply categorical representations of \texttt{educationnum}. We then removed \texttt{relationship} as it also causes multicollinearity with \texttt{sex}, as husband/wife would be associated with male/female. We lastly removed \texttt{nativecountry} simply because there are too many different categorical responses, with some holding so few observations while the variable itself has many missing values. 

     For further data cleaning, we first re-coded \texttt{sex, 50k} to binary variables, and \textbf{Federal-gov, Local-gov, State-gov} under \texttt{workclass} all to \textbf{gov}. We then added $3$ to every observation in \texttt{educationnum}, the $\#$ of years an individual spent in education, as it was strangely counting 3 years less (for example 10th grade in \texttt{education} only having \texttt{educationnum} of 7). Lastly, we removed the observations that have missing values in \texttt{workclass, occupation}, further the 21 observations with responses \textbf{Never-worked} and \textbf{Without-pay}, the dataset still has 30703 observations after data cleaning.
